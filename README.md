# Hangman
## Introduction
The game is exactly what it is called a hangman type of game that uses over 6000 words from the Estonian dictionary. It has plenty of features like a scoreboard and a about page but the game is pretty self-explanatory
## Running
In order to run the specified code JavaFX is required, but that's added through gradle
In the command line write '$ gradle run' if you're using intellij's auto-import you can find the gradle toolbar from View->Tool Windows->Gradle and from there /Tasks/application/run
## Credits
Built by Karl Taal and Martin Toode. The project was done for the course "Objektorienteeritud programmeerimine" and it's our first JavaFX experience.
